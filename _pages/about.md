I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at University of Pittsburgh and Princeton University, advised by Dr. Longfei Shangguan and Prof. Kyle Jamieson. Prior that, I was a postdoc at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. My research centers on wireless systems and networking (NextG, IoT), and mobile and ubiquitous computing (localization, multimodal sensing, and immersive virtual/augmented reality applications). *Currently, I focus on AI-driven wireless digital twins for radio world model/scene understanding, and its application for channel prediction, localization, sensing, and interaction.*

I am the recipient of the ACM China Council SIGBED Chapter Doctoral Dissertation Award 2022, IEEE SECON 2020 and 2023 Best Paper, and ACM MobiCom Best Demo Runner-up in 2018 and 2022. My works have been published in top conferences and journals such as MobiCom, MobiSys, SIGCOMM, NSDI, INFOCOM, S&P, TON, and TMC.

Feel free to explore my blog on GitBook, where I share detailed insights into my research, engineering projects, and reflections. Visit [here](https://anplus.gitbook.io/anplus).

<p><strong style="color:#FF6666;">I will be joining the School of Computing at the University of Georgia in Fall 2025. I am actively recruiting PhD students and Research Assistants to join my lab. I am always open to discussing research interests via chat. Please feel free to reach out to explore potential opportunities to work together.</strong></p>

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
