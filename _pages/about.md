I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University, advised by Prof. Kyle Jamieson. Before that, I was a postdoc at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, advised by Dr. Lei Yang. My research interests are broadly including wireless systems and networking, mobile computing, wireless sensing, and wireless security and privacy. Currently, I focus on hardware/software co-design for acoustic backscatter and sensing systems, AI-driven wireless channel prediction, and wireless localization and sensing.

I am the recipient of the ACM China Council SIGBED Chapter Doctoral Dissertation Award 2022, IEEE SECON 2020 and 2023 Best Paper, and ACM MobiCom Best Demo Runner-up in 2018 and 2022. My works have been published in top conferences and journals such as MobiCom, MobiSys, SIGCOMM, NSDI, INFOCOM, S&P, TON, and TMC.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
