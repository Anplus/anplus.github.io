I am an incoming assistant professor in the School of Computing at University of Georgia, with a start date in Fall 2025. I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pittsburgh and Princeton University, advised by [Dr. Longfei Shangguan](https://shanggdlk.github.io/) and [Prof. Kyle Jamieson](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~kylej/). Prior to that, I was a postdoc and got my Ph.D. at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where I was advised by [Dr. Lei Yang](https://web.comp.polyu.edu.hk/csyanglei/#/pages/profile/about) and [Prof. Jiannong Cao](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/). 

My research centers on wireless systems, mobile computing, and their intersection with AI. I explore physics-informed AI for intelligent communication, localization, and sensing. Recently, I focus on neural ray tracing to model and understand the wireless world, and leverage multi-sensor smart glasses for building egocentric digital twins and enabling novel human-environment interactions.

I am the recipient of the ACM China SIGBED Doctoral Dissertation Award 2022, ACM MobiCom 2023 Best Paper Runner-up, IEEE SECON 2020 and 2023 Best Paper, and ACM MobiCom Best Demo Runner-up in 2018 and 2022. My works have been published in top conferences and journals such as MobiCom, SIGCOMM, NSDI, INFOCOM, MobiSys, Sensys, S&P, RAL, TON, and TMC.

<p><strong style="color:#FF6666;">I am looking for multiple self-motivated PhD students/research assistants to start in Winter/Spring/Fall 2026. I am always open to discussing research interests Please feel free to reach out to explore potential opportunities to work together.</strong></p>
