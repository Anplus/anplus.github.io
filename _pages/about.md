I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at University of Pittsburgh and Princeton University, advised by Dr. Longfei Shangguan and Prof. Kyle Jamieson. Prior that, I was a postdoc at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. My research centers on wireless systems and networking (NextG, battery-free sensor networks, IoT security), and mobile and ubiquitous computing (localization, multimodal sensing for robotics, and immersive virtual/augmented reality applications). *Currently, I focus on AI-driven wireless digital twin for radio world model/scene understanding, and its application for channel prediction, localization, sensing, and interaction for robots.*

I am the recipient of the ACM China Council SIGBED Chapter Doctoral Dissertation Award 2022, IEEE SECON 2020 and 2023 Best Paper, and ACM MobiCom Best Demo Runner-up in 2018 and 2022. My works have been published in top conferences and journals such as MobiCom, MobiSys, SIGCOMM, NSDI, INFOCOM, S&P, TON, and TMC.

Feel free to explore my blog on GitBook, where I share detailed insights into my research, engineering projects, and reflections. Visit [here](https://anplus.gitbook.io/anplus).

<p><strong style="color:#FF6666;">I am currently on the job market, actively seeking opportunities as an Assistant Professor or Research Scientist. Feel free to reach out to discuss potential opportunities.</strong></p>
